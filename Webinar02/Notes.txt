Why version control
Backup and Restore

Synchronization

Undo
History
Sandboxing

To get the code and history of any repository, you clone it.
git clone git://github.com/rturk/ack

To create new repository
git init

To see the history of any repository, you see the log of it.
git log

You can set the current branch you are using
git branch

You can change the current branch
git checkout foobar

Once you have isolated a branch, you will want to incorporate those changes back into the main branch. You want to select the branch you want to
merge into and specify the branch you are merging from.
git checkout stable
git merge master
