Why version control
Backup and Restore
we can go back and see how the file was earlier.
Synchronization
share files and stay up to date
Undo
History
Sandboxing

To get the code and history of any repository, you clone it.
git clone git://github.com/rturk/ack

To create new repository
git init

To see the history of any repository, you see the log of it.
git log

You can set the current branch you are using
git branch

You can change the current branch
git checkout foobar

Once you have isolated a branch, you will want to incorporate those changes back into the main branch. You want to select the branch you want to
merge into and specify the branch you are merging from.
git checkout stable
git merge master

git log gives the log
git log --oneline gives the concise log
git --diff shows the difference between what is not being staged for comitting and what is already been comitted. So if you have already added
something not yet committed, it has nothing staged, so it wont show any diff

git checkout -b gitlearning
created a new branch and checked it out

//checks out existing branch
git checkout existingbranch
