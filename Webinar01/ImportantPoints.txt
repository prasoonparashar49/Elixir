Mostly, you should ask yourself before applying it. It can be used in the case when inner html is bare string

Difference between innerHtml and innerText

innerHtml += preserves html styling
innerText += doesnot preserve html styling. The styling information is taken as text.
If you want to maintain html styling also along with text you should use innerHtml, otherwise you should use innerText

For most of the times we will try to touch the DOM as less as possible, we will make our changes elsewhere and change the DOM less number of
times. Touching the DOM itself brings a lot of cost in memory cost and time cost. So while making changes in the javascript, make sure that 
you edit the DOM as less as possible.
